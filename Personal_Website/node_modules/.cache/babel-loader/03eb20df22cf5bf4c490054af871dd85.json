Yet life has changed a lot since then. I met new people, concluded my ~1.4 year journey as an army affiliate, and spent 2 months enjoying the life back as a civilian. Though things have not returned exactly the same with all the COVID mess, I nonetheless feel fortunate for path I had taken up to this point. I am still very young and have many years ahead, but there were major inflection points that made me who I am right now: KIS, Berkeley, and CFC. Transfer to KIS was a suggestion by my mother back in elementary third grade because she wanted me to learn English in a natural environment. Her initial intent was to return me back to a public Korean school after a few years, but I preferred to stay in KIS. I didn't necessary like KIS, but preferred it much more than adjusting back to a Korean public middle school which gave me stress even with the thought of it. She respected my opinion and I ended up staying in KIS for the next 8.5 years up until high school graduation. In retrospect, I did not fully utilize the environment that was provided in trade with tuition. Though I knew the annual tuition of 30 grand by number, I took it for granted and hardly put any effort. Caring nothing much but League of Legends, years have gone to waste from the end of middle school and even into college. The slack-off times accumulated over years and eventually showed up on my college results. With the help of private academic institutions, I made just the effort needed to get decent grades and standardized tests; but it was not sufficient to get me into any 'good' schools defined by general standards. I was rejected by numerous schools, waitlisted by UCLA and was considering between UIUC and Purdue. My parents, especially my mother, was disappointed with the results because it did not return their time, money and effort invested into years of my private education. Things turned around dramatically on a morning when I was on a trip with high school friends. With it, I became part of Golden Bears Class of 2021 as a Material Science and Engineering major. I was happy to get into Berkeley but felt weird I was going to leave a school I stayed for half of my life.\",\n      p2: \"Unfortunately, my inveterate habits remained the same and lasted through freshman year. Things had improved on the second year, but there were definitely huge rooms for improvement. Though the content of the classes were interesting, there were far more interesting things than college classes as a freshman. I had to socialize to meet new people and enjoy the independence from my parents. Funs years of pulling meaningless all-nighters, playing hours of games and meeting people came to an end after finishing 2019 Spring semester as I had to join the army. I felt ambivalent about the choice because I did not want to waste almost 2 years shoveling dirt but at the same time felt the need to change myself. Regardless of my feeling, with my 'relatively' healthy body, the Military Manpower Administration was requiring me to enlist. So to prevent full-time shoveling, I applied as a an army translator/interpreter, which, looking back, was the best decision ever made. Luck saved me again, thrice this time. To enroll as a translator/interpreter, I had to pass a lottery that eliminated approximately half of the applicants. The actual test was easy as an international school student. What really made me lucky was being deployed to CFC. It was a dream for all army translators/interpreters to join CFC because it meant working in a US military base placed in Itaewon. Moreover, there was going to be no shoveling, but a huge opportunity for self improvement. Yet unit deployment was purely luck, so I had no choice but to pray. Open seats for units varied every month, and the chance of going into CFC when I joined was 4 in 25, or 16%. Meanwhile, scared of the chance of being placed in an unheard infantry, I applied for a special position in the bootcamp and got up to the finalist. It was a 50 50 luck of being selected, but I was not chosen. Turns out, the position was not good at all. The special position was in the bootcamp which was far from home and had burdensome work. The third luck came along when being placed in my office. The four newbies including me were confirmed to be deployed on CFC on the last day of bootcamp and were each going to each replace the leaving Sergeants in different offices. I initially felt unlucky to be placed in C64 (Information Systems Division of Communications Directorate) due to a lot of translation/interpretation work, but the perspective gradually changed as time passed. The specialty of my office required translating document every morning. The work was easy; normally, I simply had to copy paste yesterday's work. The stress came from waking up early, but I later exploited that as a chance to finish work early and go to the office to sleep or read a book. My impression of the army life before joining was two years of shoveling while falling behind on outside affairs; my guess was completely wrong. I was placed in the best environment possible, and the world (quite literally) came to a halt with COVID. Though it was an unfortunate event for the people outside, it was surprisingly beneficial for me as a solider because the workload decreased and was granted the right to accumulate my leave days.\",\n      p3: \"For a year, I spent time with great people and was able to learn a lot.
